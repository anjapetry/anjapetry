## Hi there, hallo, bonjour, dag, hej! 👋 

<br>
🌈 I'm Anja, a self-taught frontend developer and coding bootcamp grad (Opencampus's frontend developer programme 2021/2022 in Kiel, Germany) 🌞 
My focus is on crafting accessible websites and apps with HTML, CSS (especially TailwindCSS), React.js, and Next.js with a healthy dose of GSAP and Three.js.
As a true language and art lover, I also have a keen eye for design and details.
<br/>
<br/>
🫵 Are you hiring new developers? ​I am looking for a remote, full-time position as a (junior) front-end developer! Let's talk! 📲​
<br/>
<br/>

​👩‍💻​ Presently, I'm crafting my personal website and portfolio while deepening my knowledge of React, Typescript, and Next.js. In 2024, exploring Astro is on my radar, as is expanding my accessibility skills. My goal is to become an a11y and animations expert before June 2025.
<br/>
<br/>
🔭 Further explorations: animating the web with Framer Motion, Three.js, and GSAP. 
<br/>
<br/>
🤝 Coding community: I participate in Ladies Who Code London, and regularly take part in regional & remote coding meetups and conferences.
You can find me on Discord, Medium, dev.to, and on [deta.space](https://deta.space/).
